Dada Mail

:: INTRODUCTION

Dada Mail is an intuitive, web-based e-mail list management system, which runs 
on any hosting account that can execute custom CGI scripts. Dada Mail is also 
a conceptual art project.

Dada Mail handles Closed-Loop Opt-In/Opt-Out subscriptions, sending complex 
announce-only and/or discussion mailing list messages, archiving/viewing
/searching/resending/syndicating (rss, atom) sent messages and doing all 
this and more with style.

Dada Mail produces XHTML valid web content and sticks to best practices when 
creating email messages. Write Once: Distribute Everywhere. Dada Mail is free 
software that you're able to use, modify and enhance under the terms of the 
GNU General Public License. Dada Mail is written in Perl.
