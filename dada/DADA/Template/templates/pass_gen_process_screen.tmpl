<p>
 Your encrypted password is:
</p>

<blockquote> 
 <p>
  <!-- tmpl_var encrypted_password --> 
 </p>
</blockquote>


<p>
 In your configuration file, use this password as your
  <strong> 
   $PROGRAM_ROOT_PASSWORD
  </strong>
  
  and set
  <strong> 
   $ROOT_PASS_IS_ENCRYPTED
  </strong> 
  to 
  <strong> 
   1
  </strong> 
  .
 </p>
 
 <p>
  When asked for your <!-- tmpl_var PROGRAM_NAME --> Root Password, you will still
  type in the unencrypted password, not this 
  gobbledygook.
