	<p class="error">
	 Problems were encountered when trying to send a webpage. 
	 This could be because:
	</p>
	<ul>
	 <li>
	  <p>
	   The URL you typed in is incorrect.
	  </p>
	 </li>
	 <li>
	  <p>
	   It's possible that the URL you are trying to send is blocking 
	   the request to fetch the needed information.
	  </p>
	 </li>
	 <li>
	  <p>
	   The URL you are trying to request may just be temporarily inoperable.
	  </p>
	 </li>
	 <li>
	  <p>
	   Sometimes, requests for pages coming from the same server as the 
	   script that requested them are blocked. This is to prevent infinite 
	   request loops created by badly written programs. Your system 
	   administrator will most likely have to change the server settings.
	  </p>
	 </li>
