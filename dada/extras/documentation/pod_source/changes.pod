=head2 Changes 3.0.4

This release focuses almost soley on bug fixes and ease of upgrading from previous versions, most especially, version 3.0.23 (the last stable release) and earlier versions. 

=head2 Default List Setting Changes 3.0.4

We've changed one list setting in Dada Mail, 3.0.4, C<enable_mass_subscribe>. It's now set to, C<0>. 

C<enable_mass_subscribe> changes the behaviour of Dada Mail and when set to, C<0> you won't be able to mass-subscribe subscribers, via the list control panel. 

Do not fret. 

You may enable the mass-subscription of subscribers in the list control panel,  by logging into the list control panel with the Dada Mail Root Password and going to: I<Manage List Control Panel - Options> and checking the option labeled, I<Enable, "Subscribe Checked Subscribers" button in the, Manage Subscribers -> Add -> Verify> screen. 

You may also enable this feature by default globally in the C<Config.pm> file, in the C<%LIST_SETUP_DEFAULTS> variable (look for the key, C<enable_mass_subscribe> and change its value to, C<1> 

There are really good reasons why you should not mass-subscribe people except for importing an already existing and I<verified> list. Other than that, it should never, ever be used and we'd like to hit that point home, as people, who shall remain nameless, can't possibly get a clue on why it could be a bad idea. It's 2009, by the way. 

We've written a very well thought out response and encourage you to follow good measures when adding people to your mailing list: 

http://dadamailproject.com/installation/using_dada_mail.html#subscriptions

If you cannot follow this, than maybe Dada Mail is not for you. Once again, this option can be re-enabled easily and is only disabled to give you pause and perhaps allow you to think about just what you're going to get yourself into, if you go mass-subscribing addresses without first properly validating and verifying the addresses. With that, we honestly wash our hands of this issue. 

This setting also makes it easy to globally and irrevocably disable the feature of mass-subscription of unverified addresses, by adding this list setting to the C<%LIST_SETUP_OVERRIDE> variable, like this: 

%LIST_SETUP_OVERRIDES = (
	enable_mass_subscribe => 0, 
); 

Of course, such a decision would have to be made by the person installing the program, or, providing the program for easy installation. 

=head2 CPAN Modules 3.0.4

=over

=item * LWP upgraded to: 5.827

LWP is a key module distribution for the, "Send a Webpage" functionality of Dada Mail.

=item * CGI::Sessoion upgrade to: 4.41

CGI::Session handles all session management in Dada Mail. 

=item * List-Utils Scalar-Utils

The CPAN perl modules, Scalar::Util and List::Util are included with Dada Mail, but aren't actively used, so that any 
server-wide installed versions will be used, instead. This is because the XS versions of these modules are needed for POP/SMTP 
SSL connections and having these usable by default, breaks SSL connections. The directories, 

 dada/DADA/perllib/List

and, 

 dada/DADA/perllib/Scalar

have been renamed, 

 dada/DADA/perllib/List-remove_to_install

and, 

 dada/DADA/perllib/Scalar-remove_to_install

renaming them back to their original name will make them, "active"

=head2 Changes 3.0.1

This release focuses almost soley on bug fixes and ease of upgrading from previous versions, most especially, version 3.0.0 (the last stable release)

Although we do not at all recommend this, you can install this version of Dada Mail over version 3.0.0 by uploaded all the files, except the dada/DADA/Config.pm file, using the previous version of that file, instead. 

We've also made little to no changes in any of the files in the: 

I<dada/DADA/Template/templates>

directory, except for perhaps a spelling mistake fixed (these are noted in the list of bug fixes, below). This means that any modifications you may have done to any of these files, using version 3.0.0 should be 100% compatible with 3.0.1. 

Finally, we also made minimal changes to the outsie config file examples we've included (this also goes for defaults set in the Config.pm file), so you should have no worries that the outside config file you've been using for version 3.0.0 will work for 3.0.1 - it should. 

Because of the bug-fix focus of this release and the almost 100% transparency of the configuration and template parts of Dada Mail, we suggest this upgrade to any and all users who are currently using Dada Mail, 3.0.0.

Major changes have been enacted in the mailing monitor. 

The index screen on the mailing monitor now has separate columns for:

=item * Queued

=item * Stale

=item * Broken

=back

The mailing monitor also now sorts the mailouts in the order they were created, instead of their line in the queue. The line in queue method was actually crtically confusing (even to me). 

The mailing monitor also handles, "Broken" mailouts better. There were a few notable problems with the previous revision, including:

=item * Broken Mailouts messed up the queue

If a mailout was broken, it would never leave the mail queue, so any mass mailings waiting to go out would always be stuck; since the default max number of mailouts is, 1 (this number is configurable) 

=item * Mailing monitor broken with a broken mailing

If you had a broken mailing, it wouldn't show up in the mailing monitor index - essentially breaking it, since information was missing. 

=back

Along with these problems, a lack of notice about a broken mailing plagued the entire interface - probably because of wishful thinking that a mailout would I<NEVER> become broken. Proper feedback should now be in place, in the mailing monitor index, individual mailing monitor screens, as well as the detailed and nerdy printout. 

=head3 Mailing Monitor, continued...

Much work has also been done with the mailing monitor, to deal with broken mass mailings. If a mass mailing is seen as broken, it's now also, "paused" to move it out of the way of the mail queue. 

Feedback is terribly wanted to make sure the mailing monitor and coupled auto-pickup functionality is working for you - so let us know!

=head3 Mailing Monitor  responsiveness

The responsiveness of the, pause and resume buttons, as well as seeing if a mailing is queued should be a bit better now, as the status of the mailouts is checked before a batch is begun and after a batch begins. (before it was only afterwards). Queueing, I want to say, was never checked after a mailout began, which really is a bug. 

The individual mailing monitor screens also have a way to turn off the auto-refresh, which can be annoying, if you're attemting to read the, "Verbose Sending Information" in the screen itself; 

=head3 CPAN module Juggling

The included group of CPAN modules known as, B<MIME-Tools> was downgraded in Dada Mail from version 5.426 to version 5.420. One of the reasons was that versions above 5.420 require Perl, version 5.8 to run and we're still spec'ing Dada Mail to be able to run on Perl, version 5.6. Another reason is the newest version has major conflicts with other bundled CPAN modules, as well as site-wide Perl modules, installed from CPAN. It's quite a headache. 

=head3 blog_index.cgi Plugin

The blog_index.cgi plugin has been refreshed and allows you to now embed the HTML it creates via a javascript library, or as straight HTML. A new menu item in the Admin Contol Panel has been added. 

=head3 "Send a List Message" API

The API used in the, "Send a List Message" screen has been introduced in an... introductory manner, in the, I<Integrating Dada Mail into other Programs> docs: 

L<http://dadamailproject.com/support/documentation/COOKBOOK-integration.pod.html#accessing_the__send_a_list_message_api>

If there's interest, I'll expand on this topic. 

=head3 $MONITOR_MAILOUTS_AFTER_EVERY_EXECUTION

A new Config.pm variable, C<$MONITOR_MAILOUTS_AFTER_EVERY_EXECUTION> was introducted. If set to, C<1>, Dada Mail will call the same code as it does in the Mailing Monitor and auto_pick.pl scripts in the mail.cgi script itself, after its finished with whatever else it has to do.

=head3 List Control Panel Menu Enhancements

The List Control Panel's Admin Menu menu items have been tweaked. 

The top level title, I<Customize Feature Set> has been moved below a new top level title, I<Manage List Control Panel>. Underneith this same title is a new menu item labeled, I< Options>

=head3 Customize Feature Set Changes

The option, I<Grey Out Disabled Screens> still greys out the titles on the lost control panel's admin menu, but the text is now clickable. Clicking these links will give you an error page, telling the user they don't have access to this screen. 

The order of some of the menu items have also changed. Most notably, the, B<Plugins> and, B<Extensions> items have been moved to be before the, "About Dada Mail", "Logout" and, "Log Into Another List" items. 

=head2 New Admin Screen: Manage List Control Panel - Options

Currently, it's only functionality is to enable and disable FCKeditor support. This new setting currently does not affect Beatitude (but should).

There are now messages on top of the, Send a List Message, Send a Webpage and Send a List Invitation screens to let you know if the limit of 
individual mass mailings has been reached and if the message you're about to send will be queued. This is to help any confusion about why messages don't go out 
right away.
