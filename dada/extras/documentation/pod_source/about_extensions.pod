=head1 NAME 

About Extension Scripts

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Extension Scripts> are scripts created to extend the capabilities of 
Dada Mail. Each extension script has to be installed and each script 
may need installed differently, but usually you need to upload the 
script to your hosting account (and usually in a directory in your 
cgi-bin, like /home/account/cgi-bin/dada/extensions) and change the 
permissions of the script to 755. Any other variables that need to
be set will most likely be at the top of the script itself, coupled
with directions. 

Scripts that end in '.cgi' have been written to be accessed from your
web browser, just like a normal cgi script. 

Scripts that end in '.pl' have been written to be accessed from the
command line or by a cron job or having 
a message piped to it. Many of the scripts that end in '.pl' may
not work correctly on non-UNIXy servers, like Microsoft IIS.
