<h1><a name="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<pre>
        use DADA::Security::Password</pre>
<p>Simple password checking, encrypting and generating for Dada Mail passwords,
 saved primarily in the List DB.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>Please note that I am not in any way a master or even a student of cryptology, 
for the most part, I'm using tried and true methods of encryption and taking the 
necessary precautions when I can. I don't think you should be using Dada Mail for 
International Trade Secrets. No, no. No. No. No. No. No.</p>
<p>Remember that an encryption scheme that uses a password is only as good as the password
used with it. Please, do not use 'dada' as your passwrd.</p>
<p>Many, if not all of these subroutines can be repurpused for other projects, 
any variables that don't seem to be here are in the Config.pm file, no really, check it out.</p>
<p>

<h1><a name="subroutines">SUBROUTINES</a></h1>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="checkpassword">checkpassword</a></h2>
<pre>
        my $pwcheck = ($encrupted_pass, $unencrypted_pass);</pre>
<p>This subroutine checks to see if a encrypted password matches an unencrypoted password. 
Passwords are first encrypted using your systems's <code>crypt()</code> function, the same one probably 
used for Apache Server Protected Directories and Hosting Directories themselves. The idea is
the only way to compare a password given to the saved, encrypted password, is to encrypted the 
given password, and then check out if they match.</p>
<p>This function returns 1 if the passwords  match.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="encrypt_passwd">encrypt_passwd</a></h2>
<pre>
        my $enc_pass = encrypt_passwd($string);</pre>
<p>Encrypts a string using crypt(). The salt number is created within the Config.pm file, 
every time its executed, so salt numbers are always pretty random. the encrypted password is 
made from the first 8 characters you give it, regardless of how long your password is.</p>
<p>The password that's created can only be successfully cracked using 'Brute Force' -
trying every freakin combo available. That means the more random your password, the better 
it'll be.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="generate_password">generate_password</a></h2>
<p>my $new_pass = generate_password();</p>
<p>creates a new, user-unfriendly password, full of numbers and funky symbols (all printable) 
this is primarily used when someone forgets their password and a new one needs to be made.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="rot13">rot13</a></h2>
<pre>
        my $rotpass = rot13($string);</pre>
<p>encrypts a string, using rot13.</p>
<p><strong>PLEASE BEWARE</strong> rot13 encrytpion is not very secure at all, you can decrypt it by hand. 
No, really. That's almost what it's used for. For now, its used to keep paswords that are
saved in a cooke <em>somewhat</em> secure, like secure in passerbys or someone looking over your shoulder.</p>
<p>but anyways, its a nice little thing if you ever want to rot13 a message for sending, eh?</p>
