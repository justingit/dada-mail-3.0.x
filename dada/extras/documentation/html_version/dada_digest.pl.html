<h1><a name="name_dada_digest_pl">NAME dada_digest.pl</a></h1>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>Creates a digest message from one list, to be sent to another list.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="instructions">INSTRUCTIONS</a></h1>
<p>dada_digest.pl is designed to be called from the command line or a cron
job. It is not a cgi script and shys away from the limelight that is
the Graphical WWW.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="installtion">INSTALLTION</a></h1>
<p>You need to change two things on the top of dada_digest.pl, the first 
is the <strong>$Digests</strong> variable which we'll get to shortly, the second 
thing you need to do is set the path to both the Dada libraries and 
your site's Perl library. Since dada_digest.pl will most likely but 
run from a cron job, it doesn't know off the bat where the Perl or 
the Dada libraries are. You tell the script where these places are
by tweaking the 'use lib' statement:</p>
<p>use lib qw( 
/home/account/public_html/cgi-bin/dada/ 
/home/account/public_html/cgi-bin/dada/DADA
/home/account/public_html/cgi-bin/dada/DADA/perllib
/usr/libdata/perl/5.00503/mach 
/usr/libdata/perl/5.00503 
/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.005/i386-freebsd 
/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.005 
);</p>
<p>The first two are where my Dada libraries are, they're in my cgi-bin 
right along with mail.cgi. The ones after that are places where 
the site-wide Perl libraries are located.</p>
<p>Upload dada_digest.pl to your hosting account. I recommend NOT putting 
this script in your cgi-bin, simply because it isn't a cgi-script.
You may want to make a directory for dada scripts like this one in your home account:</p>
<pre>
 mkdir /home/account/dada_scripts</pre>
<p><strong>Putting this script in your cgi-bin would probably constitute a security threat!</strong></p>
<p>change the permissions of dada_digest.pl to 755.</p>
<p>To use this script, simple run it:</p>
<pre>
 &gt;perl dada_digest.pl</pre>
<p>That's the essence of it.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="options">OPTIONS</a></h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item__2d_2dtest">--test</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>running dada_digest.pl with the test option will only send out the 
digest to the list owner. Very handy for testing purposes.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
 &gt;perl dada_digest.pl --test</pre>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item__2d_2dreset_listname">--reset listname</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>This takes a bit of explaination, but it basically resets the time
dada_digest.pl remembers when it last sent out a digest. If I send out 
a digest ever day, dada_digest.pl will remember this and won't send out
a message in a digest it has already sent. This will make 
dada_digest.pl forget this.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
 &gt;perl dada_digest.pl --reset listname</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>listname is the shortname of the list you're grabbing the messages to be
digested, not the digest list</p>
</dd>
</li>
</dl>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="setting_up_a_digest">SETTING UP A DIGEST</a></h2>
<p>To set up a digest, You need to have two lists, a list to grab the
messages to be digested from and a list to send the digest. I made a
list with a shortname of 'test' and another with a shortname of 
'digest_test'</p>
<p>People who want to have every single message sent to them would want to
subscribe to 'test', people who want the digest would want to subscribe
to 'digest_test'</p>
<p>I then have to decide what sort of time span I want to send my digest. 
I'm thinking every day will work for me.</p>
<p>Now, dada_digest.pl needs to know all of this. On the top of the script
itself is a variable called '$Digests'. To put the above information
that I just worked out into $Digests, I'd write:</p>
<pre>
        my $Digests = [ 
        {
        List_Name         =&gt; 'test', 
        Digest_List_Name  =&gt; 'digest_test',
        Message_History   =&gt;  24, 
        },
        ];</pre>
<p>Message_History work in hours, so one day equals 24 hours.</p>
<p>If I had another list, called ``ramblings'' and a list for digests called
``digest_ramblings'', that I wanted sent every 3 hours, I'd put that
after my first one:</p>
<pre>
        my $Digests = [ 
        {
        List_Name         =&gt; 'test', 
        Digest_List_Name  =&gt; 'digest_test',
        Message_History   =&gt;  24,
        },
        {
        List_Name         =&gt; 'ramblings', 
        Digest_List_Name  =&gt; 'digest_ramblings',
        Message_History   =&gt;  3,
        },
        ];</pre>
<p>All there is to it.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="setting_up_a_cron_tab">Setting up a Cron Tab</a></h2>
<p>You're most likely going to run dada_digest.pl via a crontab. Here's an
example of one:</p>
<pre>
 0 0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21 * * * /home/account/dada_scripts/dada_digest.pl</pre>
<p>This will run the script every 3 hours to check if any digests need to 
be sent out.</p>
