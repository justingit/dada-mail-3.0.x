<h1><a name="name">NAME</a></h1>
<p>send_dada_mail.pl - a small extension that allows you to send a mailing list message out from the command line.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="version">VERSION</a></h1>
<p>Refer to the version of Dada Mail you're using - NEVER use a version of this proggy with an earlier or later version of Dada Mail.</p>
<p>Saying that, this extension is a work in progress, and probably breaks all over the place.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="usage">USAGE</a></h1>
<p>This program is supposed to be used similar to how the sendmail utility is to be used - although it's not (in no way, shape or form) a sendmail command <strong>replacement</strong>. No.</p>
<p>Anyways, you can use it via the command line by calling it up:</p>
<pre>
 
    prompt:] /home/account/cgi-bin/dada/extensions/send_dada_mail.pl --list mylist</pre>
<p>And type out your message:</p>
<pre>
 Subject: This is my subject!
 
 This is my message!
 
 -- Justin
 ^D</pre>
<p>The, <strong>message</strong> part of this should be a full on email message, headers and all. As the above example shows, you can just place in the headers you'd <strong>like</strong> to have and any missing fields will be filled in intelligently for you. One header I'd make sure to put in is the <strong>Subject:</strong> header.</p>
<p>Skip <strong>two</strong> new lines and start entering your actual message.</p>
<p>Like the sendmail command, it's real use is when you call it in another script. In Perl, that would look like this:</p>
<pre>
 #!/usr/bin/perl
 
        open( DADA, &quot;|/home/youraccount/cgi-bin/dada/extensions/send_dada_mail.pl --list mylist&quot;) or die $!;
        print DADA &quot;Subject: This is my subject!\n\n&quot;;
        print DADA &quot;This is my message!\n\n&quot;;
        print DADA &quot;-- Justin&quot;;
        close DADA or die $!;</pre>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="required_arguments">REQUIRED ARGUMENTS</a></h1>
<p>As you'll notice from these examples, the, <strong>--list</strong> flag is being passed, and the paramater is set to a <strong>valid list short name</strong></p>
<p>If this paramater is missing, or the list short name is not valid the script will exit with an <code>exit</code> status of, <code>1</code> and you won't be sending anything.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="options">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p>Currently, the only flag that's accepted is the <strong>--list</strong> flag.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="diagnostics">DIAGNOSTICS</a></h1>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="configuration_and_environment">CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
<p>You probably want to set the explict paths to your Dada Mail libraries.</p>
<p>For example, if your Dada Mail installation is at:</p>
<pre>
 /home/account/cgi-bin/dada
 
Your Dada Mail libraries would be at:</pre>
<pre>
 /home/account/cgi-bin/dada
 
and:</pre>
<pre>
 /home/account/cgi-bin/dada/DADA/perllib
 
The following lines on top of this script would be changed from:</pre>
<p>use lib qw(</p>
<p>../
../DADA
../DADA/perllib</p>
<p>);</p>
<p>to:</p>
<p>use lib qw(</p>
<p>../
../DADA
../DADA/perllib</p>
<pre>
 /home/account/cgi-bin/dada
 /home/account/cgi-bin/dada/DADA/perllib
 
);</pre>
<p>

<h2><a name="dada_mail_3_x_support">Dada Mail 3.x support</a></h2>
<p>I haven't tested this with Dada Mail 3.x yet. Does it work well?</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="security">SECURITY</a></h2>
<p>Currently, there's not much security in this script - only the check for a valid list short name. Normally, you'd have to either log into the List Control Panel to send a message out, which requires a password, or, use the Dada Bridge Plugin, which has it's own slew of checks.</p>
<p>Because of that, I'd only use this script where you're mighty sure that abuse will not happen (ha.). Abuse of this extension is quite possible and very easy, as you're giving the option of any program to send to any Dada Mail-administrated list as much as it would like. You see where I'm going here with this. OK? Ok.</p>
<p>Future versions will most likely have some semblance of security and feedback (general) about this extension is more than welcome.</p>
