<h1><a name="the_dada_mail_spam_faq">The Dada Mail SPAM FAQ</a></h1>
<p>This document is to highlight, bold and underline the stance of the author and his views on SPAM.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_is_dada_mail_created_to_send_spam">Is Dada Mail created to send SPAM</a></strong>

<p>No,</p>
<p>Dada Mail has been created to allow people to send email to a subscription list.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_do_you_send_spam">Do you send SPAM</a></strong>

<p>No,</p>
<p>I do not send SPAM</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_does_any_of_the_hosting_providers_that_you_rent_or">Does any of the hosting providers that you rent or buy from send SPAM or 
use any equipment that they own or rent to send SPAM</a></strong>

<p>No, they do not. My hosting providers also, do not send SPAM and have been 
incredibly understanding with false reports.</p>
<p>My hosting providers businesses are at stake if they are, in fact, blacklisted and they do not appreciate fake reports of SPAM on their system.</p>
<p>My hosting providers understand Dada Mail and thus have no problem with its development.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_i_have_gotten_spam_email_from_what_i_think_is_dada">I have gotten SPAM email from what I think is Dada Mail, I though you 
said you don't send SPAM, what's the story?</a></strong>

<p>Dada Mail is not a hosted program, Dada Mail is downloaded and installed on a server and all activity by the program happens at that point. I do not have any control over what people do with the program.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_is_there_a_backdoor_to_dada_mail_so_that_i_can_hac">Is there a backdoor to Dada Mail so that I can hack the installation and give those spamers a lesson?</a></strong>

<p>No,</p>
<p>there is no backdoor to Dada Mail. Hacking someone elses site is unethical and probably illegal. An eye for an eye is not the way to go.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_i_27ve_gotten_spam_from_what_i_think_is_dada_mail_">I've gotten SPAM from what I think is Dada Mail, I want off. Can you get me off?</a></strong>

<p>No, but I can help you get off.</p>
<p>The default, 'out of the box', distribution that you get from the Dada Mail support website has many, many ways to unsubscribe and unless a SPAMMER actually changes the underlying code of Dada Mail, they should all work:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_default_footer">Default Footer</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Each mailing list Message sent using Dada Mail will have a default footer with instructions on how to unsubscribe and a link you can click to unsubscribe yourself.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_list_headers">List Headers</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Each mailing list message send using Dada Mail will contain email list headers that look like this:</p>
</dd>
<dd>

<p>I like to give this quote out:</p>

        I think that technologies are morally neutral until we apply them. 
        It's only when we use them for good or for evil that they become good or
         evil 
                - William Gibson</pre>
<p>I created Dada Mail for people to communicate. For me, Dada Mail is an art project. I have given anyone, anywhere a canvas to voice their dreams and it doesn't cost them anything to use. I want Dada Mail to be used to send out beautiful prose, a life's thesis, updates to the health of a loved one, a cry for help to a righteous cause. Abusing this right I've given you just reflects on the person's character. Dada Mail is a powerful tool, power can be currupted. Please do not be the one that currupts.</p>
