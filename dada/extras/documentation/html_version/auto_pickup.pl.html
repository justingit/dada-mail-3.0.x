<h1><a name="name">NAME</a></h1>
<p>auto_pickup.pl - A small extension to monitor mailings and auto reload them if they seem to have fallen off the wayside.</p>
<p>This script can easily be run this as a CGI script in your web browser  or via the command line.</p>
<p>The main intention of this script is to have it be run via a cronjob.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="version">VERSION</a></h1>
<p>Refer to the version of Dada Mail you're using - NEVER use a version of this program with an earlier or later version of Dada Mail.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="usage">USAGE</a></h1>
<p>This little program can be used two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_use_it_like_a_cgi_script_2e">Use it like a cgi script.</a></strong>

<p>Put it in your, <strong>extensions</strong> directory (ala: cgi-bin/dada/extensions), chmod 755, visit it in your web browser.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_use_it_like_a_command_line_script">Use it like a command line script</a></strong>

<p>Change into the directory it's located in, and type:</p>
<pre>
 ./auto_pickup.pl</pre>
<p>This script takes <strong>one</strong> argument: <a href="#item__2d_2dverbose"><code>--verbose</code></a>. Tack that flag on:</p>
<pre>
 ./auto_pickup.pl --verbose</pre>
<p>and you'll receive a nice printout. Call it without any arguments and it won't return anything - it'll just run, and exit. Good for a cronjob.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="required_arguments">REQUIRED ARGUMENTS</a></h1>
<p>There are no required arguments.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="options">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item__2d_2dverbose">--verbose</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>As explained, prints out what's goin' on. Probably a good option to use, if you've never used this specific extension.</p>
</dd>
</li>
</dl>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>Mailing to your entire list in Dada Mail can take a long time - hours even. Sometimes - and depending on your hosting account setup, this process can go on longer than the server allows a process to run.</p>
<p>Dada Mail itself is written to understand this problem and to work around it, but keeping exact track on where in the mass mailing it is and then being able to, ``pick up'' the mass mailing from the exact point it was, ``dropped''.</p>
<p>Since Dada Mail does not run continuously itself, you do need to monitor the sending process for this ``auto pick up'' to work.</p>
<p>One way is to keep the, Sending Monitor open in the List Control Panel. This works great, but has the problem of you always having to have your web browser open, your computer on, your computer to be connected to the internet, etc.  Tak about a kludge.</p>
<p>Another way to use this very little extension script.</p>
<p>We highly highly recommend using this very little extension script.</p>
<p>Having this script run every 5 minutes or so should relieve you of having to monitor your mailing yourself and should stop you from worrying about a long-running mass mailing process.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="configuration_and_environment">CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
<p>We've tried to make this script as easy as possible to get up and running, in hopes you'll take advantage of it.</p>
<p>There is no configuration needed to be done.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="running_the_script_via_a_cronjob">Running the script via a cronjob</a></h2>
<p>There's two ways you can run this script as a cronjob, either directly or by accessing it like you would in a web browser.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="running_the_extension_directly">Running the extension directly</a></h3>
<p>To use this style, you'll have to know the absolute path to your, <em>dada/extensions</em> directory. For example:</p>
<p><em>/home/myaccount/cgi-bin/dada/extensions</em></p>
<p>Is an example of an absolute path to an <em>dada/extensions</em> directory.</p>
<p><em>/home/myaccount</em> is the path to my home directory. In my home directory, lives my <em>cgi-bin</em> directory and inside that directory, is my <em>dada</em> directiory, which, in turn, holds the <em>extensions</em> directory. Hazzah!</p>
<p>These paths, especially the path to your home directory are going to be unique to your hosting account setup, so make sure to figure out yours is configured to be, exactly.</p>
<p>To run this extension every 5 minutes, your cronjob will look like this:</p>
<p>*/5 * * * * cd /home/myaccount/cgi-bin/dada/extensions; /usr/bin/perl ./auto_pickup.pl</p>
<p>If you have ssh access to your hosting account, you can test if you have the right commands that make up the cronjob by running the command right on the command line:</p>
<pre>
 prompt&gt;cd /home/myaccount/cgi-bin/dada/extensions; /usr/bin/perl ./auto_pickup.pl</pre>
<p>If nothing gets printed, you probably have it installed correctly. To be sure, use the C--verbose&gt; flag:</p>
<pre>
 prompt&gt;cd /home/myaccount/cgi-bin/dada/extensions; /usr/bin/perl ./auto_pickup.pl --verbose</pre>
<p>You should get a report on any mass mailings that are going out and their status.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="running_the_extension_via_curl">Running the extension via curl</a></h3>
<p>The second style is to use something like, <code>curl</code> to access the extension, much like you would in your web browser.</p>
<p>In these examples, I'm using,</p>
<p><em>/usr/bin/curl</em></p>
<p>as my path to curl. You'll want to double-check what your path to curl is.</p>
<p>In my below examples, the URL to this extension is:</p>
<p><em><a href="http://example.com/cgi-bin/dada/extensions/auto_pickup.pl">http://example.com/cgi-bin/dada/extensions/auto_pickup.pl</a></em></p>
<p>You'll want to replace this with your actual URL to this script. To double check, just visit this URL in your web browser.</p>
<p>To run this extension every 5 minutes, your cronjob will look like this:</p>
<pre>
 */5 * * * * /usr/bin/curl <a href="http://example.com/cgi-bin/dada/extensions/auto_pickup.pl">http://example.com/cgi-bin/dada/extensions/auto_pickup.pl</a></pre>
<p>You may receive the verbose printout using this method, so you may want to pass the, ``verbose'' paramater. This should work:</p>
<pre>
 */5 * * * * /usr/bin/curl <a href="http://example.com/cgi-bin/dada/extensions/auto_pickup.pl?verbose=0">http://example.com/cgi-bin/dada/extensions/auto_pickup.pl?verbose=0</a></pre>
<p>If not, try this:</p>
<pre>
 */5 * * * * /usr/bin/curl -s --get --data verbose=0  --url  <a href="http://example.com/cgi-bin/dada/extensions/auto_pickup.pl">http://example.com/cgi-bin/dada/extensions/auto_pickup.pl</a></pre>
