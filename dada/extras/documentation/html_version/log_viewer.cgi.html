<h1><a name="plugin__log_viewer_cgi__view_logs_created_by_dada_mail">Plugin: log_viewer.cgi - View Logs Created by Dada Mail</a></h1>
<p>This plugin allows you to view the Dada Mail, Error, Bounce and Clickthrough logs
that  Dada Mail creates in its activities through your web browser.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="installation">Installation</a></h2>
<p>Upload log_viewer.cgi into your cgi-bin. We suggest you create 
a 'plugins' directory in the same directory that the mail.cgi script 
is in. For example. If mail.cgi is at:</p>
<pre>
 /home/account/cgi-bin/dada/mail.cgi</pre>
<p>create a directory called plugins at:</p>
<pre>
  /home/account/cgi-bin/dada/plugins</pre>
<p>and upload this script into that directory:</p>
<pre>
 /home/account/cgi-bin/dada/plugins/log_viewer.cgi</pre>
<p>Once uploaded in plain text or ASCII mode, chmod the script to 755.</p>
<p>Add this entry to the $ADMIN_MENU array ref:</p>
<pre>
         {-Title          =&gt; 'View Logs', 
          -Title_URL      =&gt; $PLUGIN_URL.&quot;/log_viewer.cgi&quot;,
          -Function       =&gt; 'log_viewer',
          -Activated      =&gt; 1, 
          },</pre>
<p>It's possible that this has already been added to $ADMIN_MENU and all
you would need to do is uncomment this entry.</p>
