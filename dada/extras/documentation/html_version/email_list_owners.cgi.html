<h1><a name="plugin__email_list_owners_cgi__email_all_list_owners">Plugin: email_list_owners.cgi - Email All List Owners</a></h1>
<p>This plugin allows any list owner to email every other list owner.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="installation">Installation</a></h2>
<p>Upload email_list_owners.cgi into your cgi-bin. We suggest you create 
a 'plugins' directory in the same directory that the mail.cgi script 
is in. For example. If mail.cgi is at:</p>
<pre>
 /home/account/cgi-bin/dada/mail.cgi</pre>
<p>create a directory called plugins at:</p>
<pre>
  /home/account/cgi-bin/dada/plugins</pre>
<p>and upload this script into that directory:</p>
<pre>
 /home/account/cgi-bin/dada/plugins/email_list_owners.cgi</pre>
<p>Once uploaded in plain text or ASCII mode, chmod the script to 755.</p>
<p>Add this entry to the $ADMIN_MENU array ref:</p>
<pre>
         {-Title           =&gt; 'Email All List Owners', 
           -Title_URL      =&gt; $PLUGIN_URL.&quot;/email_list_owners.cgi&quot;,
           -Function       =&gt; 'email_list_owners',
           -Activated      =&gt; 1, 
          },</pre>
<p>It's possible that this has already been added to $ADMIN_MENU and all
you would need to do is uncomment this entry.</p>
