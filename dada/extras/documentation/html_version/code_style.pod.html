<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>This document is to help in understanding how Dada Mail is written.</p>
<p>Some of the main goals for these guidelines are to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_make_it_easier_for_multiple_people_to_work_on_the_">Make it easier for multiple people to work on the same project at once</a></strong>

<li><strong><a name="item_make_it_easier_to_test_and_debug_the_program_or_pa">Make it easier to test and debug the program or parts of the program</a></strong>

<li><strong><a name="item_set_a_bar_on_the_level_of_code_kwelity">Set a bar on the level of code Kwelity</a></strong>

</ul>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="perl">Perl</a></h1>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_t">All code must run under the -T (taint) flag. No exceptions.</a></strong>

<li><strong><a name="item_all_code_2c_unless_specifically_noted_2c_should_be">All code, unless specifically noted, should be able to run given the system requirements of Dada Mail.</a></strong>

<p>If any of the code does not, the specific function must be optional. For 
example, a simple way to see if sending a webpage is supported is to <code>eval()</code> 
the LWP::Simple module. If it returns no errors, we can use the subroutine 
that depends on it. For example:</p>
<pre>
 my $can_use_lwp_simple; 
 eval { require LWP::Simple; };
 $can_use_lwp_simple = 1        
        if !$@;</pre>
<p>If there is simply no workaround, the best thing to do would be to make a 
specific plugin/extension that has the wanted functionality.</p>
<p>This also encapsulates OS-specific features. For the moment, Dada Mail is 
Unix-centric and does not work reliably on Windows platforms.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_no_inline_html">NO inline HTML</a></strong>

<p>There <em>is</em> inline HTML in Dada Mail - we know. It's old code that's 
currently being pulled out of the program. No new inline HTML code will 
be accepted into Dada Mail. None. Nada. Zip.</p>
<p>Please see code that refers to the DADA::Template::Widgets ``screen'' 
subroutine for ways to hook in HTML::Template with Dada Mail. See the 
HTML::Template documentation at:</p>
<p><a href="http://search.cpan.org/~samtregar/HTML-Template/Template.pm">http://search.cpan.org/~samtregar/HTML-Template/Template.pm</a></p>
<p>For information on how to work with HTML::Template documents 
(hint: it's pretty easy)</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_code_style">Code Style</a></strong>

<p>While there is no main Perl code style for Dada Mail, code for readability 
over anything else; code for expandability of features rather than 
succinctness.</p>
<p>Any advice given in <em>Perl Best Practices</em> by Damian Conway is good advice by us:</p>

<h1><a name="html__template_templates">HTML::Template Templates</a></h1>
<p>HTML::Template is the templating language used for most all of Dada 
Mail's screens. Currently there is <em>some</em> inline HTML and we'd like 
to get rid of all of this ASAP.</p>
<p>Currently, there are three categories of templates. The first category 
is for the different top-level (X)HTML document/page types. And the 
latter two categories, which are the bits and pieces that then get 
included into those top-level templates, are Dada Mail-centric.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a name="item_top_2dlevel_templates">top-level templates</a></strong>

<p>Templates that end in ``template.tmpl'' are the ``document containers'' for 
the various types of pages/screens in Dada Mail. Or to put it another 
way: these are the ones we'd add an ``.html'' extension to if it weren't 
for their HTML::Template includes.</p>
<p>These document containers include the bare-minimum (X)HTML structure for 
the document (e.g.: the doctype, head, and body), plus the general 
structure of the type of page in question (for instance, separate #Header 
and #Content sections for default_list_template.tmpl).</p>
<p>A few extra &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; ``wrappers'' can also be found in some of 
these templates, for CSS customization and cross-browser bugfixing 
purposes. To keep things as clean and user-friendly as possible, we'd 
like to keep these ``extra'' structural wrappers meaningful (like the #Logo 
and #Title wrappers inside the #Header), and to a minimum (no redundant 
divs-within-divs, unless there's a <em>really</em> good reason). [At the 
moment, this is still a work in progress.]</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_screens">screens</a></strong>

<p>Templates that end in ``screen.tmpl'' are basically the chunks of code 
that get inserted into the top-level document templates, and that contain 
all the interesting, screen-specific content you'll see in your web browser.</p>
<p>NO screens should have form field without a &lt;form&gt;&lt;/form&gt; tag pair 
surrounding the form. DO NOT assume that there will be these tags available.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_widgets">widgets</a></strong>

<p>Templates that end in ``widget.tmpl'' are parts of a whole screen, and are 
usually inserted into a screen or another widget using the 
&lt;!-- tmpl_include ... --&gt; tag.</p>
<p>The whole idea of a widget is to allow you to use the same snippet of code 
in more than one template.</p>
<p>If the widget has part of a form in it - i.e.: an input tag of some type - 
please document this fact somewhere near the top of the script, as it aids 
debugging.</p>
<p>NO widgets are allowed to have a unpaired form tag.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="begin_end_comments_in_html__template_templates">begin/end comments in HTML::Template templates</a></h2>
<p>When making a new template, always put a:</p>
<pre>
 &lt;!-- begin templatename.tmpl --&gt;</pre>
<p>tag at the beginning of the file and a:</p>
<pre>
 &lt;!-- end templatename.tmpl --&gt;</pre>
<p>tag at the end of the file. This makes it easy for developers and end-users 
alike to debug or customize things by reading the output source code (using 
their browser's ``view source'' feature) and tracking any line back to the 
template that created it.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="css">CSS</a></h1>
<p>Must be valid, unless it's an absolutely unavoidable hack.</p>
<p>Absolutely unavoidable hacks must be well-commented.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="javascript">JavaScript</a></h1>
<p>We really <em>ought to</em> avoid the six ``bad practices'' at:</p>
<pre>
 <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2005/06/three_javascrip_1.html">http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2005/06/three_javascrip_1.html</a></pre>
<p>but we haven't quite gotten to #6 yet (I'm thinking here of the admin 
template's: &lt;body onLoad=``init();''&gt; ). And similarly, we should probably 
also be shooting for ``unobstrusive JavaScript'' as per:</p>
<pre>
 <a href="http://www.onlinetools.org/articles/unobtrusivejavascript/">http://www.onlinetools.org/articles/unobtrusivejavascript/</a></pre>
<p>but on that front, we're not even close.</p>
<p>Assistance and experience here would be greatly appreciated. :-)</p>

<h1><a name="commenting_code">Commenting Code</a></h1>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="begin_end_comments_in_html__template_templates">begin/end comments in HTML::Template templates</a></h2>
<p>These are the,</p>
<pre>
 &lt;!-- begin templatename.tmpl --&gt;</pre>
<p>and:</p>
<pre>
 &lt;!-- end templatename.tmpl --&gt;</pre>
<p>Already discussed.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="other">Other</a></h2>
<p>Several other proposed labels have been put into place for development 
purposes. All are <strong>optional</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_dev_3a_2fdev">DEV:/DEV</a></strong>

<p>As of this writing, ``DEV:'' - usually with the colon, and often ending 
with the writer's initials - is being used to label temporary 
inter-developer communication. For example:</p>
<pre>
 &lt;!-- DEV: added a flaming GIF logo here. what do you think? -js --&gt;</pre>
<p>The use of this in combination with TODO has some inter-developer 
requesting possiblities as well:</p>
<pre>
 &lt;!-- DEV: TODO: I need a custom variable here instead of this placeholder, 
      but don't have the Perl chops to create it. 
      (P.S. - What *is* a chop, anyway?) -sc 
 --&gt;
 &lt;!-- DEV: The chop() function in Perl chops off the last character 
      of a string and returns the character chopped.  Yuck yuck yuck yuck. 
      
      More seriously, it's better to use the chomp() subroutine. noob. 
      -js
 --&gt; 
 
Generally speaking, all DEV:s should be grokked, resolved and deleted 
before a stable release.</pre>
<p><strong>TIP:</strong> A quick and dirty way to find out all the DEV: comments would be 
to use the grep utility, like so:</p>
<pre>
 grep -r DEV: dada</pre>
<p>where, ``dada'' is the name of your Dada Mail directory.</p>
<p><strong>BBEdit</strong> also has the, <em>Multi-File-Search</em> option.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_hack">HACK</a></strong>

<p>Used to denote that a particular coding style isn't something that 
should be followed, but works on the current situation.</p>
<p>A small description should follow the label, allowing people insight on 
why a hack was put in place. For example:</p>
<pre>
 # HACK - too drunk.</pre>
<p>or,</p>
<pre>
 # HACK This is old code, put in here where listshortnames were the same as list names and both 
 # could have spaces in the names. This should be looked at, removed and tested soon.
 $args{-List} =~ s/ /_/i if $args{-List};</pre>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_howto">HOWTO</a></strong>

<p>Used to provide a helping hand for folks getting their feet wet in 
customizing Dada Mail. For example (in mail.cgi):</p>
<pre>
 # HOWTO: 
 # To make the default message subject on the &quot;Send a List Message&quot; screen
 # read: &quot;yourlistname&quot; (without the quotes), change the above variable to:
 # 
 # my $message_subject = $li-&gt;{list_name};</pre>
<p>Basically, HOWTO provides an instructional bridge for people who want to 
go beyond the customization options available in Config.pm, default_css.css,
and the default templates, but who aren't yet Perl (or Dada Mail) experts.
Whether or not you use the HOWTO flag, doing this here and there is a really 
nice afterthought if you have the time and inclination.</p>
<p>It may be up to the developers to apply the HOWTO labels after a release of 
a stable distribution, based on answers to questions put forth by users that 
are pushing the features that Dada Mail does make easily available. These 
labels could then be compiled in a interesting list of cool things to do 
with Dada Mail, or reviewed to see if any of the features talked about 
could - or should - be more easily accessible.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_todo">TODO</a></strong>

<p>Marks an area that needs work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Any other ideas are appreciated. I'd rather have TOO MUCH commenting going 
on than too little.</p>
