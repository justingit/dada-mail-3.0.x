<ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_list_settings_sql_backend__2d">List Settings SQL Backend -</a></strong>

<p>Available for MySQL and Postgres</p>
<p>Pretty easy to set up, create the table located in dada/extras/SQL/dada_settings.sql - which is: 
</p>
<pre>

 CREATE TABLE dada_settings (
 list                             text,
 setting                          text,
 value                            text 
 );</pre>
<p>and set the, $SETTINGS_DB_TYPE to MySQL, or Postgres</p>
<p>DB FIle to *SQL migration isn't too hard, see the script, dada_settings_dbtosql.pl in the dada/extras/scripts directory,</p>
<p>Whose instructions are:</p>
<p>Name dada_settings_dbtosql.pl
Description
    Cute name, huh?</p>
<pre>
    Basically, this small script takes the information of a Dada Mail list
    settings in the DB File and ports it to the MySQL format.</pre>
<pre>
    Fairly simple and straightforward.</pre>
<p>How to use this script
    * Backup Everything
        SQL tables, list files (all of them)</p>
<pre>
    * Create the List Settings SQL table
        The SQL statement to run should be saved in a file called
        *dada_settings.sql* which is located in the *dada/extras/SQL*
        directory of the distribution</pre>
<pre>
    * Set $SETTINGS_DB_TYPE to the correct SQL type (MySQL, Postgres)
        Directions are located in the Config.pm about this, search for,
        *$SETTINGS_DB_TYPE*</pre>
<pre>
    * Fill in %SQL_PARAMS in the Config.pm file
        Again, directions should be supplied in the Config.pm file.</pre>
<pre>
    After the above (do not skip a step) are done, make sure Dada Mail is
    still running by visiting it in your webbrowser. The program should run
    as if no lists existed - not to worry! We shall fix that soon enough.</pre>
<pre>
    Upload this script into the same directory that you have the *mail.cgi*
    script in, and run it, either from your web browser, or via the command
    line.</pre>
<pre>
    That should be it.</pre>
<pre>
    ps. backup everything.</pre>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_archive_editor_plugin_has_been_removed">Archive Editor plugin has been removed</a></strong>

<p>Archive editor functionality added to the main mail.cgi script - meaning, you don't have to install this plugin separately.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_archived_messages_search_speed_vastly_improved_for">Archived Messages Search speed vastly improved for SQL backend.</a></strong>

<li><strong><a name="item_messages">[website_name] and [website_url] are now valid pseudo-tags for email messages (sort of a hidden feature - but requested)</a></strong>

<li><strong><a name="item_screen_caching_21">Screen Caching!</a></strong>

<p>Screen caching saves many of the HTML screens Dada Mail displays, so they don't have to be rendered twice! This could mean a serious speed up to the Dada Mail UI. More information:</p>
<p><a href="faq.pod.html#is_there_a_way_to_speed_up_screen_rendering__how_to_use_the_screen_cache_">faq.pod.html#is_there_a_way_to_speed_up_screen_rendering__how_to_use_the_screen_cache_</a></p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_redirect_w_2fquery_string_21">Redirect w/Query String!</a></strong>

<p>You can now use the URL Redirects for the confirmation process while also passing a query string to the URL you're redirecting to! This query string holds things like, if the action was successful, the email address used and any errors encountered. Handy!</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_limit_subscription_confirmation_sending">Limit Subscription Confirmation Sending</a></strong>

<p>When enabled, only one confirmation message can be sent out at one time per subscriber, without the subscriber manually requesting (basically, clicking a button) a new subsciption confirmation to be sent. This helps cut down on unneeded message sending and abuse of the subscription confirmation system.</p>

<h1><a name="version_2_9">Version 2.9</a></h1>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="syndication">Syndication</a></h2>
<p>Of all the features of Dada Mail, I'm actually excited about this feature the most.</p>
<p>Why? Because this feature turns a mailing list manager with archiving abilities into something truly amazing. Think about it:</p>
<p>You send a message out, the message gets archived. It now exists as two things:</p>
<p>An email message, destined to your subscribers inbox, and content on your website.</p>
<p>With the addition of RSS Syndication, it also exists as part of an RSS feed, anyone can pick up.</p>
<p>2.9 adds the following to this mix:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_atom_syndication_support">Atom Syndication Support</a></strong>

<p>Atom Described:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.atomenabled.org/">http://www.atomenabled.org/</a></p>
<p>RSS ver .91 already comes with Dada Mail, but Atom support is pure icing. It's a bit better and supposively easier to work with development-wise. It also says, ``yes, we're really serious about this whole syndication thing''</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_pinging_update_services">Pinging Update Services</a></strong>

<p>Dada Mail 2.9 doesn't just syndicate its content, it'll reach out and let the major update services know about the updates.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, to get back to our, ``what happens to your mailing list message'' train of thought -</p>
<p>Message gets delivered, message gets archived, message is syndicated, update services are notified.</p>
<p>Some of these update services, like <a href="http://technorati.com">http://technorati.com</a> have a search engine, of just syndicated information for you to search through - Dada Mail let's Technorati know a new message has been sent, the message gets placed in Technorati's search results - in almost real time - truly incredible.</p>
<p>If you haven't noticed - this is almost exactly what a weblog does - sans perhaps the trackback URL and comments on the individual entries. The advantage of using Dada Mail is obviously the whole, ``it's first and foremost a mailing list manager'' - I still believe that there's greate value in using a Mailing List Manager. Used correctly, mailing list messages are really really useful.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="send_an_archived_message_to_a_friend_feature__rewritten">Send an archived message to a friend feature - rewritten</a></h2>
<p>Most of mail.cgi was rewritten, but I wanted to spotlight the Send an Archived Message to a Friend feature, which has been entirely rewritten; to sort of go with the above, your message is also <em>resendable</em> from visitors of your site, to their friends.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="mail_cgi__rewritten__basically_">mail.cgi - rewritten (basically)</a></h2>
<p>We didn't mean to, but the mail.cgi is rewritten. It weighs in almost 100k less 
than the previous version. Wow!</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="browserbased_html_message_editor">Browser-based HTML Message Editor</a></h2>
<p>HTMLArea, a browser-based WYSIWYG editor can now be integrated easily into Dada Mail. This means you can write richly formatted HTML, right in your web browser. The program has limited support for copying/pasting formatted text from products like <code>Microsoft(tm)</code> Word.</p>
<p>Instructions are here:</p>
<p><a href="Config.pm.html#html_area_integration___htmlarea_url">Config.pm.html#html_area_integration___htmlarea_url</a></p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="list_screens">List Screens</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_breadcrumbs">Breadcrumbs</a></strong>

<p>I noticed that navigating the list screens - meaning the screens created by Dada Mail that have to deal with a certain list, isn't very easy.</p>
<p>I put in place breadcrumb links to help you navigate the different areas. It's nice.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="archive_screens">Archive Screens</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_displaying_complex_html_messages">Displaying Complex HTML Messages</a></strong>

<p>A problem with being able to send very complex email messages, is that you have to support <em>viewing</em> the email messages that you send, if you have your archives available. In the past, Dada Mail's support for viewing multipart/alternative messages, with or without attachments was dismal.</p>
<p>Dada Mail now has great support to parse and display its archived messages. Messages authored using the, ``Send a Webpage'' technique show up absolutely perfectly.</p>
<p>(attachments are still not supported, although the encoded content does not spill out as a garbled mess in the archive screens)</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_archive__22blurbs_22">Archive ``Blurbs''</a></strong>

<p>Archive ``blurbs'' have been developed, to show a snippet of an archived message, viewable befiore you click and see the entire archived message. In a glance, you can get an idea on what kind of messages are sent out in a given list.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="email_formatting">Email Formatting</a></h2>
<p>Dada Mail now has an honest to goodness Email Message formatter that is completely MIME aware.</p>
<p>What's this mean? It means that your list templates will be applied correctly. It means that attachments work. It means your messages won't be flagged by email filters for poor formatting. It means you don't have to be an expert (really) on how to format email messages. You just need to write them.</p>
<p><strong>More on this subject -</strong></p>
<p>Using SpamAssassin as my test ( <a href="http://spamassassin.org">http://spamassassin.org</a> ), I've been working on making Dada Mail's messages score better on the various torture tests it puts email messages, destined for your mailbox through. I used Spamassassin because it's well documented and is the basis of many commerical products, as well as it's own Open Source implementation.</p>
<p>To be direct and honest, my work on Dada Mail was <strong>not</strong> to apply <em>tricks</em> to get through SpamAssassin and other filters, but <strong>to use best practices</strong> when it comes to formatting email messages. Again. No tricks. None. Best practices - yes!</p>
<p>Some tests were surprising to me; for instance, a message formatted in HTML, but not having a proper format - ie: no start/end &lt;head&gt; tag, no start/end &lt;body&gt; tag, no start/end &lt;html&gt; tag get a significant penalty. Because of this, Dada Mail will now make sure that all HTML messages sent using the program will comply to this standard.</p>
<p>Another test that was surprising to me was finding out that HTML messages sent out without a PlainText version (known as a multipart/alternative message) get a similar rather significant penalty. Because of this, all HTML messages, sent using Dada Mail will include a PlainText version of the message <strong>automatically</strong> - meaning, you don't have to worry about it.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="path_infos">Path Infos</a></h2>
<p>Many, many many of the Query Strings in Dada Mail - and not only in email messages, use a path info, instead of a query string. Here's a real example:</p>
<p>Query String Version:</p>
<p><a href="http://justinsimoni.com/cgi-bin/dada/mail.cgi?flavor=archive;list=announce;id=20040604025003">http://justinsimoni.com/cgi-bin/dada/mail.cgi?flavor=archive;list=announce;id=20040604025003</a></p>
<p>Path Info Version:</p>
<p><a href="http://justinsimoni.com/cgi-bin/dada/mail.cgi/archive/announce/20040604025003/">http://justinsimoni.com/cgi-bin/dada/mail.cgi/archive/announce/20040604025003/</a></p>
<p>Both of these URLs go to the same screen.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_the_path_info_version_is_more_compact">The Path Info version is more compact</a></strong>

<li><strong><a name="item_the_path_info_version_is_more_clear">The Path Info version is more clear</a></strong>

<li><strong><a name="item_the_path_info_version_is_way_more_search_2dengine_">The Path Info version is way more search-engine-friendly</a></strong>

<li><strong><a name="item_the_path_info_masquerades_like_it_27s_a_directory_">The Path Info masquerades like it's a directory structure</a></strong>

</ul>
<p>Another example:</p>
<p>Query String Version:</p>
<p><a href="http://example.com/cgi-bin/dada/mail.cgi?f=n&l=announce&e=justin%40example.com&p=8911234">http://example.com/cgi-bin/dada/mail.cgi?f=n&l=announce&e=justin%40example.com&p=8911234</a></p>
<p><a href="http://example.com/cgi-bin/dada/mail.cgi/n/announce/justin/example.com/8911234/">http://example.com/cgi-bin/dada/mail.cgi/n/announce/justin/example.com/8911234/</a></p>
<p>Slightly shorter. Nicely shorter.</p>
<p>The email address is also now embedded within the URL, instead of being blatantly
encoded in - notice the, %40 in the query string version. %'s in URL's are a big no-no for some services, like AOL. Hopefully, that problem is fixed now</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="verp_support">VERP support</a></h2>
<p>A nerdy feature, here's a nerdy description:</p>
<p><a href="http://cr.yp.to/proto/verp.txt">http://cr.yp.to/proto/verp.txt</a></p>
<p>In summary, VERP support means that we embed the recipient of a mailing list message into the Return-Path header of the message itself.</p>
<p>This is neat because:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_helps_parse_bounces">Helps parse bounces</a></strong>

<p>It'll be easy to find out the true bouncing email address of a message</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_aol_21">AOL!</a></strong>

<p>if you get a complaint from AOL, you'll be able to pick out what the email address is, and, for example, unsubscribe them from your list;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="fast_list_switching">Fast List Switching</a></h2>
<p>If you have more than one list, log into one of them using your Dada Root Password. You'll see on the right hand side a little widget to switch to the other lists available with a simple click. Handy.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="batch_notification_enhancements">Batch Notification Enhancements</a></h2>
<p>You can now be notified after every <strong>x</strong> batches are completed, instead of every batch. Seems like a silly feature, unless you have a large lists and small batches.</p>
<p>Batch notices should also now include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_how_long_the_mailing_has_taken">How long the mailing has taken</a></strong>

<li><strong><a name="item_a_guess_on_how_long_is_left_in_the_mailing">A guess on how long is left in the mailing</a></strong>

</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="internal_templates">Internal Templates</a></h2>
<p>A very large and very justified complaint about Dada Mail was that most of the HTML of the program was embedded in the Perl code itself. This makes customizing, editing and translating the display text next to impossible.</p>
<p>We are very happy to announce that most (~ 95%) of the display text used in Dada Mail has been templated out!</p>
<p>This has several advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_mail_2ecgi_is_much_smaller">mail.cgi is much smaller</a></strong>

<p>Less embedded HTML in the mail.cgi file means that Dada Mail will start up faster and take less resources to run.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_mail_2ecgi_is_easier_to_maintain">mail.cgi is easier to maintain</a></strong>

<p>mail.cgi was rewritten - mostly by taking out the embedded HTML; the resulting mail.cgi file is much more easier to develop with - especially if you're not completely familiar with everything;</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_customizable_3f_oh_yes_2e_customizable_2e">Customizable? Oh yes. Customizable.</a></strong>

<p>There are currently about 70 templates in the template directory of Dada Mail located at:</p>
<p>dada/DADA/Templates/template</p>
<p>All these internal templates are created using the freely available HTML::Template CPAN module. Learn its templating language here:</p>
<p><a href="http://search.cpan.org/~samtregar/HTML-Template-2.7/Template.pm">http://search.cpan.org/~samtregar/HTML-Template-2.7/Template.pm</a></p>
<p>It's made to be very simple.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the more notable templated out HTML are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_the_default_list_template">The Default List Template</a></strong>

<p>dada/DADA/Template/templates/default_list_template.tmpl</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_the_default_admin_template">The Default Admin Template</a></strong>

<p>dada/DADA/Template/templates/default_admin_template.tmpl</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_the_default_css_file_3a">The Default CSS file:</a></strong>

<p>dada/DADA/Template/templates/default_css.css</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="subscriber_help_screen">Subscriber Help Screen</a></h2>
<p>There's a new screen in Dada Mail to help would-be subscribers make sure they actually <em>receive</em> the email confirmation message. Basically, it points out how 
to add the list owner's email into the address book/white list/safe list/whatever-it's-called of their email reader. I don't have even the beginning of all the mail readers available, but it's better than nothing. Here's a real world example:</p>
<p><a href="http://justinsimoni.com/cgi-bin/dada/mail.cgi/subscriber_help/announce/">http://justinsimoni.com/cgi-bin/dada/mail.cgi/subscriber_help/announce/</a></p>
<p>The whole idea, again, is not to trick or hack about the problem, but to face the problem, and come up with a solution. Mail readers filter/flag email messages coming through, sometimes they suck at it - here's a way, using the mail reader to work around such suckage.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="html_screens__xhtml_compatible">HTML Screens - XHTML Compatible</a></h2>
<p>The original look and feel of Dada Mail was basically finalized in version <strong>ONE</strong> of the program. Since then, minor tweaks have been done to the design, but it's basically been the brown header, and content in a small, hairline bordered table.</p>
<p>The design itself was pretty good for 1999, whipped up by some 18-year-old punk, but times have changed and web browsers have caught up to web standards and there's better ways to format things than tables within tables within tables.</p>
<p>Saying that, The default Administration Template and List Template are completely xHTML Transitional compatible. Much work has been done to make sure every screen validates.</p>
<p>The design itself has been refreshed slightly, fonts are somewhat larger and screen real estate is being taken more advantage of. You won't be too lost using Dada Mail 2.9 if you're upgrading from an earlier verison, but it's a welcome surprise.</p>
<p>Some of the smaller enhancements are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_button_styles__2d_out_of_the_config_2epm_file">button styles - out of the Config.pm file</a></strong>

<p>For reasons that elude me, the Button styles for Dada Mail were kept in the Config.pm file, under the <strong>%STYLE</strong> hash. These are now deprecated, and the styles themselves have been moved to the default css file.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="log_in_security">Log In Security</a></h2>
<p>If the needed parts are available (you'll need Perl 5.6), Dada Mail now saves the log in information NOT in the cookie, but rather in what's called a session file. What's this mean? It means you're not passing the list name and (encrypted) list password back and forth from the server to your web browser every time you access the list admin control panel. Depending on how you look at this, this is either a secuirty enhancement or a security hole blocked. I'll leave that up to you;</p>
<p>
