=head1 Name dada_archive_dbtosql.pl

=head1 Description

Cute name, huh? 

Basically, this small script takes the information of a Dada Mail archive in the DB File and ports it to the MySQL format.

Fairly simple and straightforward. 

=head1 How to use this script

=over

=item * Backup Everything

SQL tables, list files (all of them) 

=item * Create the Archives SQL table

The SQL statement to run should be saved in a file called I<dada_archives.sql> which is located in the I<dada/extras/SQL> directory of the distribution

=item * Set B<ARCHIVE_DB_TYPE> to the correct SQL type (MySQL, Postgres)

Directions are located in the Config.pm about this, search for, I<$ARCHIVE_DB_TYPE>

=item * Fill in %SQL_PARAMS in the Config.pm file

Again, directions should be supplied in the Config.pm file. 

=back

After the above (do not skip a step) are done, make sure Dada Mail is still running by visiting it in your webbrowser. The program should run exactly as before, except no archives should be available. 

Upload this script into the same directory that you have the I<mail.cgi> script in, and run it, either from your web browser, or via the command line. 

That should be it. 


ps. backup everything.
